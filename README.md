# Blockchain-Extension-for-PostgreSQL-Data-Storage
Big data storage is a part of almost each life area. Database usage is a standard way to organize information and gather and querying data in such systems. The lack of audit tools is an issue in many applications, especially for users without full access or without enough resources to look up the data storage. The blockchain is an emerging technology with the potential to resolve such issues. 

Numerous classical database systems operate nowadays. Enabling new blockchain-related features for them implies moving to a platform with another database inside or duplicating its parts in a blockchain system. Both ways are difficult to migrate and maintain. The paper describes how to organize blockchain extension for the data storage using the database for a particular example of an account-based cryptocurrency prototype so that the transaction and balance requests can support cryptographic proofs for the response correctness. The numerical experiments to check an overhead of the proposed extension are provided.
